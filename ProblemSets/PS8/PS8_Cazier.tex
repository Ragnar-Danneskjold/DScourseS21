\section{Model Summary From R}
Can't get the modelsummary to work for me right now for some reason. I'll figure that out later, but in a nutshell, most estimates were reasonably close to true, although several of my estimates were obviously bugged and off, and one I did not yet get working. Specifically, the nelder-mead code I used did not return values that were close to true, and I'll have to do more work to figure out whats going on there, and the same goes for the L-BFGS algorithm, but I'm turning in the code I have done anyways.

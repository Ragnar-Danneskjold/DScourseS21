\section{My interest in economics began in high school, when I took our school's micro and macro economics classes. I enjoyed both enough I eventually decided to major in the subject here at OU. I thought this course looked interesting, as I enjoy the programming knowledge I've picked up this far, and the course looked useful as well. I have no idea what I'd like to do for my project, I typically have a difficult time coming up with subjects for research projects that I find compelling. My goals for this class are to continue learning about using R to gather data and build models, building on what I was taught last semester.}
